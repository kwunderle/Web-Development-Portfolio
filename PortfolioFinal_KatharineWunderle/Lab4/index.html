		<h2>A Tool For Life</h2>
			<p>Sewing is a great hobby that can be both fun and practical. Everyone wears clothes, and the ability to repair, alter, or even create items from scratch can be an invaluable tool for anyone. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination and your access to materials. Craft stores, like <a href="https://www.joann.com/">Joanne Fabrics</a> and <a href="https://www.michaels.com/">Michael’s</a> can be a great place to start. Thrift stores can also be a great resource for fabric and notions. You can make a lot out of a bedsheet! It is amazing to create a project and admire your work, but the following skills could greatly benefit you or a friend.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Replace a Button</li>
				<li>Fix a Zipper</li>
				<li>Patch or Mend a Tear</li>
				<li>Hem Something</li>
				<li>Take Something In</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may have needed someone to do one of these things for you at some point in time. Or perhaps needed it and wished you could do it yourself. All of these skills can be easily learned.</p>

		<h2>Pick a Project</h2>
			<p>The best way to learn how to sew is to decide on something that you would like to make or a specific task that you would like to master. Start with something simple, and by simple, I mean something with only a few pieces to assemble, like a skirt or pajama pants. Tablecloths and decorative wall hangings are also great places to start. Once you know what you would like to do, you can then make sure you have the proper materials and equipment. Some things you might want to have on hand are;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Basic Sewing Machine - Click <a href="machines.html">here</a> to learn about different ones.</li>
				<li>Needles and Thread</li>
				<li>Fabric Scissors</li>
				<li>Seam Ripper</li>
				<li>Fabric</li>
				<li>Patterns</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are a variety of ways to begin your journey. There are books available for purchase that are filled with construction techniques and stitch patterns. On the web you can find tutorial videos that are easy to follow along to help jumpstart and guide your sewing education. Check the book section at that thrift store while you’re looking for fabric, you never know what kind of guides you could find.</p>

		<h1 id="nopattern">No Pattern? No Problem!</h1>
			<p>The most important thing for whatever it is that you’re making if the pattern. It is a blueprint of the pieces of our project that come together like a puzzle as you stitch them together. Pattern drafting is a meticulous art form that requires an understanding of geometry and the utmost precision if you wish your garments to fit correctly. If you don’t want to learn the ins and outs of how to make your own patterns, then you’re in luck. There are a variety of companies that specialize in fashion patterns that come in a wide variety of clothes, costumes, and other projects. The big retail companies you might have heard of are <a href="https://www.simplicity.com/">Simplicity</a> and <a href="http://www.voguepatterns.us/">McCall’s</a>. Their patterns can be found on their sites or in select big box stores. There are several smaller companies that offer a great variety as well and there are a growing number of independent designers selling their patterns digitally in the form of PDF files. These patterns come with detailed instructions on how to construct your project and can be a great learning tool. There’s also a list that includes all the materials to put it together, including what type of fabric.</p>
