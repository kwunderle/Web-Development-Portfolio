		<h1>The Right Tool for the Right Job</h1>
		<h2>Domestic Sewing Machine</h2>
		<p>The most common machines you see in the home can be either digital or analogue and can either be automatic or hand cranked. These types of machines can have anywhere from 2 to hundreds of stitch options. Most domestic fabrics can be manipulated by these machines, even in multiple layers.</p>
		<h2>Overlock Machine</h2>
		<p>For the more finished work, an overlock, also known as a cover stitch machine is the tool for you. The specialized gears not only locks your stitch in place with a looping, interlocking stitch, it also trims your edges along the seam line for a more professional look.</p>
		<h2>Embroidery Machine</h2>
		<p>The beauty of embroidery machines is that they are so easy to use and can give your projects a truly unique look. Most of these machines come with user friendly software that allows the user to select from a variety of image options or upload and format their own. The machine uses multiple colors of thread to build designs to take everything you make to the next level. </p>
