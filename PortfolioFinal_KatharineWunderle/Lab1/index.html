			<h1>HTML</h1>
			<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard way a web page is built. Physicist Tim Berners-Lee proposed and developed the first version in the early 1990s and it has had several different versions since then. HTML 4.01 was the official standard for many years with the implementation of tables, style sheets, and Javascript. The language is composed of different elements represented by tags. The start and end tags organize and differentiate the content in-between them. The tags are enclosed by angle brackets. These elements can be further defined with different attributes that give them a specific look or function. HTML allows users to structure these elements into a fully customized web page.</p>

			<h1>HTML5</h1>
			<p>HTML5 is the fifth and most recent version of HTML. This new markup language is the result of a collaborative effort made by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group and the World Wide Web Consortium. First introduced to the public in 2008, the additions of single tags for audio, video, and interactive capabilities made it much more versatile in our digital age. The use of scalable vector graphics allows the user to easily view the web page on a desktop, smartphone, tablet, or any size screen comfortably. Many new elements and attributes were added, while some were altered, redefined, or completely eliminated. With this new iteration of the language, it has never been easier to design a diverse and flexible web page.</p>

			<h1>CSS</h1>
			<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a style sheet language used to further customize the way all the elements look in your HTML.  Style sheets have been around since the 80s but were not compatible for use on the web. CSS was co-created by web pioneer HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and computer scientist Bert Bos, the first version being released in 1996. With the use of multiple layers of style sheets in your markup language, you can tailor the look of your background, text, image presentation, and so much more. Before its introduction, style formatting had to be written directly into the HTML and it became a real headache for developers. The development of CSS greatly increased the versatility of the way things are designed and presented on the web.</p>
