		<p>Accessibility on the web for everyone is important. But some people require extra assistance for tasks in every-day life and navigating the web is no exception. It is crucial to take these things into account when designing your site. Presenting your content in multiple ways and keeping your design simple will help you go far no matter your audience. Everyone can benefit from the techniques used to make the web more accessible. Here are some ways to improve your design to include various types of assistance.</p>

		<h2 id="auditory">Auditory</h2>
		<p>This could range from someone who is completely deaf to someone that has slight hearing difficulty. Tools like transcribing text from an audio file in the form of a separate file or subtitles can allow those with hearing issues to experience what the content has to offer.</p>

		<h2 id="visual">Visual</h2>
		<p>This could range from individuals who are completely blind and require the assistance of screen readers to hear the content they cannot see. A skip navigation link can be invaluable. Someone with a less severe visual condition could benefit from larger text sizes and easy to read fonts. Colorblindness can make viewing images or certain color schemes difficult if not impossible to read. Additional CSS can allow you present different color combinations that can be viewed with more success for different types of vision.</p>

		<h2 id="cognitive">Cognitive</h2>
		<p>A case of ADHD would benefit from the lack of distracting animations or gifs to help focus better on the content. Someone with dyslexia would struggle with text heavy sites so it is prudent to break up your content into well-organized blurbs.</p>

		<p>There are many pieces of hardware that can be helpful to those with motor skill issues. But on your site you can implement keyboard shortcuts to help someone who cannot use a mouse well. The navigation should be clear and simple and easy to get to.</p>
