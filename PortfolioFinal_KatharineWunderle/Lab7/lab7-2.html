		<h3>Random Favorite: The Collector</h3>
			<p>From Norman Bates in Psycho and the many sequels and iterations to Jason Vorhees (and originally his mother) in the many Friday the 13th films, slasher flicks are all about a killer stalking their prey. Their motivations vary and are sometimes not defined at all, we find ourselves focusing on the chase and wondering who among the trope of friends will survive. Classically we have a final girl who makes it to the end to thwart our would be killer, and maybe even save one of her friends.</p>

		<h3>Random Favorite: The Host</h3>
			<p>These are any film that involves a fictional creature, whether it be in the woods, the ocean, the desert, or under your bed. This can be a school of deadly piranhas, a wild animal that has mutated or grown to an uncontrollable size, or a something created in a lab or an experiment. This genre has many different subgenres that are often considered their own category. Some popular ones are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vampires</li>
					<li>Werewolves</li>
					<li>Zombies</li>
					<li>Kaiju (Giant monsters)</li>
					<li>Extraterrestrials</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Random Favorite: Sinister</h3>
			<p>The human fascination with life beyond death has helped shape our fascination with trying to reach and understand what is beyond the veil. True stories like The Amityville Horror and others like it where a family is tormented by unknown forces are common. Along with more sensationalized tales of demon summoning and possession.</p>

		<h2 id="bodyhorror">Body Horror</h2>
		<h3>Random Favorite: The Perfection</h3>
			<p>David Cronenburg is coined as one of the creators of this genre, with films such as The Fly or Scanners. Like the name implies, the movies explore visceral bodily transformations, traversing the deepest realms of the psychological. Everyone has a body so it is easy to relate the terrors in these kinds of films and it can easily make you uncomfortable.<p>
